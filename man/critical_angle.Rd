\title{Compute the critical angle for the test of the angle between two multivariate vectors}
\usage{
critical_angle(dimensions, alpha = 0.05, prec = "normal")
}
\arguments{
\item{dimensions}{number of dimensions to use}

\item{alpha}{significance level (by default 0.05)}

\item{prec}{whether one has to use the internal R functions ("normal", default), or mpfr precision ("mpfr")}
}
\value{
The function outputs the critical angle (in degrees)
}
\description{
This function computes the angle below which two vectors would be "significantly similar" using Li 2011 test.
}
\details{
This function considers the formulas in Li 2011 which have been used to perform a test
of the angle between multivariate vectors.
This is the test implemented in MorphoJ (Klingenberg 2011),
in the R package Morpho (Schlager 2016), and in the function TestOfAngle of this package.
The test produces a p value for the angle between two vectors
(with significant values being "significantly similar").

This function reverts the logic of the formula/test and, given a number of dimensions
(e.g., morphometric variables) and a level of significance (by default 0.05),
it computes the angle below which the test would be significant.
}
\section{Notice}{

In case of very many dimensions, there are numerical problems in performing the test.
If prec="normal" the function uses internally the package Morpho (which should be installed)
and these problems will start occurring above about 340 variables.
If prec="mpfr" the function uses internally a custom function which requires the package
Rmpfr (which should be installed).
This allows the computation of extremely large or small numbers, it is currently set
to a 120 bit precision and allows the computation using up to about 1200 variables
(over this number, there will be problems even using the option "mpfr")
