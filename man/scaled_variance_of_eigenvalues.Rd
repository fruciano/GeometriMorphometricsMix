\title{Compute scaled variance of eigenvalues}
\usage{
scaled_variance_of_eigenvalues(data_matrix, boot = 999, rarefy = FALSE,
  shrinkage = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_matrix}{Matrix or data frame containing the original data
(observations in rows, variables in columns).}

\item{boot}{number of bootstrap resamples (no bootstrap if 0)}

\item{rarefy}{logical on whether a rarefaction to a smaller sample size should be performed}

\item{shrinkage}{logical on whether the analysis should be based on a covariance matrix obtained through linear shrinkage}
}
\value{
If boot=0 the function outputs a vector containing
the scaled variance of eigenvalues
and the number of dimensions used in the computations.
If, instead, boot>0 (recommended) the function outputs a list containing
\itemize{
  \item the mean scaled variance of eigenvalues across all bootstrap samples
  \item the median number of dimensions used across all bootstrap samples
  \item the 95% confidence intervals for scaled variance of eigenvalues and dimensions
  \item the scaled variance of eigenvalues and dimensions used for each of the bootstrap replicates
}
}
\description{
Compute estimates of the scaled variance of eigenvalues using only the positive eigenvalues
}
\details{
The function allows computing the scaled variance of eigenvalues (Pavlicev et al. 2009)
under a variety of settings.
The scaled variance of eigenvalues is a commonly used index of morphological integration.
Its value is comprised between 0 and 1, with larger values suggesting stronger integration.

Only positive eigenvalues are used in the computations used in this function.

The function employes two possible strategies to obtain eigenvalues:

\itemize{
  \item a singular value decomposition of the data matrix (default)
  \item an eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix estimated using linear shrinkage (option shrinkage=TRUE; Ledoit & Wolf 2004)
}

Further, the function allows obtaining bootstrapped estimates by
setting boot to the number of bootstrap replicates (resampling with replacement)

It is also possible to obtain rarefied estimates by setting rarefy to the desired sample size.
This is useful when comparing the scaled variance of eigenvalues across multiple groups with different sample sizes.
In this case, the suggestion is to use either the smallest sample size or less

Using a bootstrap estimate with the singular value decomposition approach
represents a good compromise between computation time and accuracy.
This should be complemented by rarefaction to the smallest sample size (or lower)
in case one wants to compare the value obtained across different groups.

\section{Notice}{

When boot>0 the rarefied estimates are based on sampling with replacement (bootstrap).
However, if boot=0, then a \strong{single} rarefied estimate is obtained by sampling without replacement.
In this case, the user should repeat the same operation multiple times (e.g., 100)
and take the average of the scaled variance of eigenvalues obtained.

Also notice that using the shrinkage-based estimation of the covariance matrix requires longer computational time and memory.
This option requires the package \emph{nlshrink}
