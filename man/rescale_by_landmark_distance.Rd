\title{Rescale landmark data based on interlandmark distances}
\usage{
rescale_by_landmark_distance(Data, lm1, lm2, lengths)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{array k x p x n of k landmarks and p dimensions for n observations (specimens)}

\item{lm1, lm2}{index of the two landmarks whose inter-landmark distance is known}

\item{lengths}{vector of n lengths (distances between lm1 and lm2 in the appropriate scale)}
}
\value{
The function outputs an array k x p x n of rescaled landmark coordinates
}
\description{
Convenience function which rescales a dataset of landmarks
based on a vector of distances between two landmarks
}
\details{
This function can be useful when one has the distance between two landmarks
(e.g., obtained with a caliper), but a scale has not been set
when acquiring the data (for instance, a scale bar was missing on photos,
so configuration of landmarks are scaled in pixels).
