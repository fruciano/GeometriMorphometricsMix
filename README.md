Miscellaneous geometric morphometric functions

This repository contains a few useful and fairly diverse geometric morphometric functions which may be useful to others.
All the functions are reasonably well commented with information on usage and similar.

-**EscoufierRVrarefy.R** : Computation of rarefied estimates of Escoufier RV (see Fruciano et al. 2013 - Plos One)
-**Kmultparallel.R** : Parallelised computation of Adams' Kmult (useful for distribution of trees, see Fruciano et al. 2017 - Ecology and Evolution)
