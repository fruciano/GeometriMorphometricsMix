Miscellaneous geometric morphometric functions

This repository contains a few useful and fairly diverse geometric morphometric functions which may be useful to others.
All the functions are reasonably well commented with information on usage and similar.

- **EscoufierRVrarefy.R** : Computation of rarefied estimates of Escoufier RV (see Fruciano et al. 2013 - Plos One)
- **Kmultparallel.R** : Parallelised computation of Adams' Kmult (useful for distributions of trees, see Fruciano et al. 2017 - Ecology and Evolution)
- **ProjectOrthogonal.R** : Projects data to subspace orthogonal to a given vector (for use in allometric correction, see Burnaby 1966 - Biometrics; Rohlf & Bookstein 1987 - Systematic Zoology; for use in dealing with measurement error, see Valentin et al. 2008 - Journal of Fish Biology; Fruciano 2016 - Development Genes and Evolution)
