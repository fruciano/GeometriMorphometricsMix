\title{Project to subspace orthogonal to a vector}
\usage{
ProjectOrthogonal(Data, vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{matrix n x p of n observation for p variables,}

\item{vector}{column vector (matrix p x 1 of p variables)}
}
\value{
The function outputs a matrix n x p of the original data projected
to the subspace orthogonal to the vector
}
\description{
This function projects data to the subspace orthogonal to a multivariate column vector
}
\details{
This function is useful to remove from a dataset the variation along a specific direction
(e.g., a principal component).
It has been used extensively for many applications, such as
 \itemize{
  \item 'Size Correction' (removal of an allometric vector),
  also called 'Burnaby's method (Burnaby 1966; see also Rohlf & Bookstein 1987)
  \item Remove body arching from fish (Valentin et al. 2008; see also Fruciano 2016
  for a discussion and other examples of usage in the context of measurement error
  in geometric morphometrics)
  \item Removing variation due to sexual dimorphism on a set of individuals with
  unknown sex (Fruciano et al. 2014)
}
Optionally, vector can also be a matrix with more than one column
(in this case the Data is projected to the subspace orthogonal to the space
spanned by all dimensions in vector)

\examples{
library(MASS)
A=mvrnorm(50,mu=rep(1,50),Sigma=diag(50))
B=mvrnorm(50,mu=rep(0,50),Sigma=diag(50))
AB=rbind(A,B)
Group=as.factor(c(rep(1,50),rep(2,50)))
# Create two groups of observations (e.g., specimens)
# one centered at 0 and the other at 1
# and combine them in a single sample

PCA=prcomp(AB)
# Combine the two groups and perform a PCA

plot(PCA$x[,1],PCA$x[,2], asp=1, col=Group)
# Plot the scores along the first two principal components
# The two groups are clearly distinct (red and black)

ABproj=ProjectOrthogonal(AB,cbind(PCA$rotation[,1]))
# Project the original data (both groups)
# to the subspace orthogonal to the first principal component
# (which is the direction along which there is most of variation among groups)

PCAproj=prcomp(ABproj)
# Perform a new PCA on the 'corrected' dataset

plot(PCAproj$x[,1], PCAproj$x[,2], asp=1, col=Group)
# Plot the scores along the first two principal components
# of the 'corrected' data
# Notice how the two groups are now pretty much indistinguishable
