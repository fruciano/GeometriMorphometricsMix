#' Perform a test of the angle between two multivariate vectors
#'
#' This function performs a test for the angle between two multivariate vector, optionally allowing for "flipping" one of the axes
#'
#' This function is useful to perform a test of the angle between two multivariate vectors
#' (e.g., principal component eigenvectors computed from two covariance matrices, such as covariance matrices of two different species).
#' The function uses internally angleTest from the package Morpho by Stefan Schlager.
#' That function, in turn, uses the formulas in Li 2011 to compute significance, rather than using permutations.
#' This is the same approach also implemented in MorphoJ (Klingenberg 2011).
#' There is no special advantage in using this function relative to the original in the package Morpho, except that
#' this function outputs angles both in radians and degrees and that it optionally allow to
#' "flip" one of the two axes. This is useful in the cases where the direction of one axis is arbitrary,
#' such as in PCA (where positive and negative values are interchangable and recomputing PCA might result
#' in positive scores for the observations which were negative (and vice versa).
#' In this situation, angles larger than 90 degrees are not meaningful and one way of dealing with this is,
#' by choosing the option flip=TRUE (default), to change the sign of one of the two vectors ("flip").
#'
#' @section Notice:
#' The p value is for the probability that the angle between two random vectors is smaller or equal to the one
#' computed from the vectors provided (x, y). This means that significant values indicate that the two
#' provided vectors are "significantly similar", whereas non-significant values means that the two vectors
#' are substantially different
#' 
#' @param x,y numerical vectors
#' @param flip logical stating whether (TRUE, default) axes should be "flipped" in case the angle is larger than 90 degrees (see Details)
#'
#' @return The function outputs a list with
#' \item{angle}{angle between vectors in radians}
#' \item{angle_deg}{angle between vectors in degrees}
#' \item{p.value}{p value}

#' to the subspace orthogonal to the vector
